        <p>
            This recipe means a lot to me because my mom has been making it for me and my siblings since 2017. From the
            very
            first time I tried it, I completely fell in love with it. It’s spicy, full of flavor, and the kind of dish
            that
            instantly makes your mouth water — especially if you’re a fan of bold, spicy food!
        </p>
        <p>
            I learned this recipe from my mom, and now it’s become my own special version. I wanted to share it with
            everyone who loves macaroni or spaghetti but prefers something with a little more heat. Most people usually
            make
            these dishes with a mild or creamy flavor, but my mom came up with a version that’s packed with spice and
            excitement — perfect for those of us who like a bit of a kick in every bite.
        </p>
        <p>
            The best part? It’s super easy to make! Just follow the steps carefully, and you’ll end up with a delicious,
            spicy macaroni that’s comforting, flavorful, and sure to become one of your favorites.

        <h2 class="mheading">Steps</h2>


        <strong class="lheading">Step 1: Boil the macaroni:</strong>
        <p>
            In a small pot, bring water to a boil. Add 1 tbsp of oil and salt to taste. Once the water is
            boiling,
            add the macaroni and cook for 7–8 minutes until tender. Drain the water completely, rinse the
            macaroni
            with cold water, and then lightly coat it with a little oil to keep it from sticking. Set aside.
        </p>


        <strong class="lheading">Step 2: Prepare the chicken and sauce:</strong>
        <p>
            Heat oil in a pan and sauté the onion, ginger, and garlic until light golden brown. Add the chicken
            pieces and cook until they turn white.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, add the <strong>Bake Parlour BBQ Macaroni spice sachet</strong> (the one that comes in the
            box).
            You can also use your own homemade BBQ seasoning or any brand you prefer. Pour in 1 cup of water,
            cover
            the pan, and let the chicken cook until it becomes tender.
        </p>


        <strong class="lheading">Step 3: Thicken the sauce and add vegetables:</strong>
        <p>
            Once the chicken is cooked, add cornflour to slightly thicken the gravy. Then add the boiled
            macaroni, chopped capsicum, carrot, and cabbage. Cover and cook for 2 minutes only — the vegetables
            should stay crisp and colorful, not overcooked.
        </p>


        <strong class="lheading">Step 4: Add the smoky BBQ flavor:</strong>
        <p>
            Heat a small piece of charcoal until red-hot. Place it in a small bowl and carefully set it inside
            the pan. Drizzle a few drops of oil over the charcoal to release smoke, then immediately cover the
            pan for a few minutes to infuse that rich, smoky BBQ aroma into your macaroni.
        </p>


        <strong class="lheading">Step 5: Serve and enjoy:</strong>
        <p>
            Your hot and spicy <strong>Chicken BBQ Macaroni</strong> is now ready! Enjoy it fresh — full of
            flavor, spice, and that irresistible smoky touch.
